//TODO: Implement callback handling to update order status if needed
// This is a placeholder. You'll need to implement the logic to:
// 1. Verify the data received from Novapay (if necessary).
// 2. Update the order status in WooCommerce based on the payment status.
// 3. Redirect the user to the order received page or a custom thank you page.
